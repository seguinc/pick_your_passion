# Pick Your Passion

**P**ick **Y**our **P**assion is a project started in 2019 by Geoff Koch. This project brings together "a group of folks that work at Higher Education Institutions. These folks meet quarterly to discuss analysis projects they have done that relate to the quarter's chosen topic. The goal of this community is to provide support for each other's passions while giving others inspiration to develop their analytical and data visualization skills.".
